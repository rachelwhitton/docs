Our command line interface, Terminus, provides advanced interaction with Pantheon. Terminus enables you to do almost everything in a terminal that you can do in the Dashboard, and much more.

<a href="/docs/terminus/install">Install Terminus</a> on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows 7 and 10. For details on legacy versions of terminus, see [Legacy Terminus Versions](/docs/terminus/get-started/legacy).
## Usage

Use Terminus to perform these and other operations:  

- Create a new site
- Create and delete Multidev environments
- Clone one environment to another
- Check for and apply upstream updates
- Deploy code from one environment to another

<p>If you are a plugin author, you will need to update your plugin to the Terminus 1.0 syntax. See <a href="/docs/terminus/get-started/legacy">Legacy Terminus Versions</a> to compare the difference in command syntax.</p>
