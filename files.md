Files are user uploads, usually images or documents. They are excluded from version control via Pantheon's .gitignore files:

- [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/blob/master/.gitignore)
- [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/blob/master/.gitignore)

The Pantheon architecture is comprised of highly available [application containers](/docs/application-containers/) that are seamlessly integrated with Valhalla, our cloud-based filesystem. This means that your files are not local to the application containers running your site's codebase.

Valhalla symbolically links the `wp-content/uploads` directory for WordPress and the `sites/default/files` directory for Drupal to the Valhalla files directory mount point, `/files` if viewed via an SFTP client. It is important to note that this directory is not part of the document root and is not directly web-accessible. Should you wish to make this accessible, you will need to create an additional symbolic link from within the document root.  Any [non-standard file locations](/docs/non-standard-file-paths/) should be symbolically linked to `/files` or moved manually.

## Access via SFTP
You can connect directly to the filesystem by copying your [connection information](/docs/sftp#sftp-connection-information) into popular SFTP clients such as [Filezilla](/docs/filezilla/) and navigating to the `/files` directory.

## Pantheon-Related Files
When you are logged in to your application server, you may notice some files that you don't recognize. Don't worryâ€”we put them there, and here's why:

**fusedav_version**: shows the version of fusedav being used.

**fusedav.conf**: is the client configuration file for fusedav. fusedav is software used to mount shared storage (the folder */files*) to the application server. This folder is where your content-related files (images, attachments, and other things not stored in version control) are kept. For Drupal sites, there is a symlink to it from `sites/default/files`. For WordPress sites, there is a symlink from `wp-content/uploads`.

**htpasswd**: is used when you want to lock your environment with a username and password. There is a Public button on each environment Dashboard that you can click to add a username and password to your site. This will keep your site hidden while you're working on it.
