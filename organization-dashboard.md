The Organization Dashboard is where you manage all your sites in a single location. You can access support requests, add or remove organizational team members, and manage new or existing sites.

## Add Sites to Your Organization

### New Sites

While creating a new site, any user in your [organization](/docs/organizations/) will see an "Organization Affiliation" select field containing any organizations to which he or she belongs. New sites affiliated this way are automatically added to your Organization Dashboard, and the user who creates the site is made the owner.

### Existing Sites

From the Site Dashboard you want to add:


1. Click **Team**.
2. Click **Add Supporting Organization**.
3. Search for your Organization.
4. Click **Add**.


## Manage Site Teams
If you need to add developers as full team members to a site, or outside contractors to individual sites, you'll need to add them to the site team:

1. Check the box next to the site or sites you want to add the user to.
2. Click **Team** and **Add a team member**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Click **Add team member**.

The user will receive an email notification with a link to the Site Dashboard.

Removing site team members follows the same process.


## Filter Sites

At the Sites tab, the left panel contains groups of filters for limiting the sites list. Filters will appear in each group as sites are added that match the filters. You can add custom tags by selecting the checkbox next to the site, and clicking **Tags** and **Add Tag(s)**, then entering the tag.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p>Tags are case-sensitve.
</p>
</div>
To remove tags, select the site(s) you want to remove and follow the procedure above, this time selecting **Remove Tag**, or by hovering over the tag and clicking the **x** that appears.

## Add Users to Your Organization

1. Click on the **People tab**.
2. Click **Add user**.
3. Enter the user's email address.
4. Choose the user's role.
5. Click **Add user**.

If the person does not yet have a Pantheon account, they will receive an email with an invitation to create one. Once they have successfully created an account, they will be automatically added to the Organization. If they already have an account, they will receive an email with a link to the Organization's dashboard.
