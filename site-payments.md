##Select a Plan and Add a Credit Card

1. From your User Dashboard, choose the site you want to add a card to.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Choose a plan.
Depending on the plan you choose, you'll get access to additional features like adding a custom domain name to your site, or for Pro accounts and higher, adding SSL and more. For more information on plans and features, see [Pricing](https://pantheon.io/pricing).
4. Invite someone to pay for the site or enter the credit card information, and click **Update Billing**.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Warning</h4>
<p>We do not recommend entering your client's credit card information on their behalf. Instead, go to <strong>Settings</strong>, select <strong>Plan</strong>, and choose <strong>Invite a business owner to pay for this site</strong>. Enter the business owner's email address, select the correct plan level, and click <strong>Send invitation</strong>. Site ownership and billing will be transferred to the business owner once their credit card information and payment has been verified.</p>

## Accessing Premium Features

Developing your site and enjoying the advanced features like Workflow, Team Management, and [New Relic Pro](/docs/new-relic) can all be accessed for free; however, there are also premium features that require you to have a payment method associated with your site.

For example, when enabling HTTPS you are prompted to update your site's plan:
 ![To enable SSL - choose at least a Pro plan](/source/docs/assets/images/dashboard/update-plan-prompt-https.png)
Clicking the message takes you to the Billing page to either select a plan or to enter your payment information.
