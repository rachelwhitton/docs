Welcome! This guide is designed to get you started on Pantheon.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Create a free sandbox site on Pantheon
- Use separate Dev, Test, and Live environments in a best-practice development workflow
- Perform on-server development via our SFTP Connection Mode

All you need before you begin is a Pantheon account. If you don't have one, <a href="https://pantheon.io/register" target="_blank">sign up now for free <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt"></span></a>.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p>Are you an agency? Do you build sites for others? If so, check <strong>Are you an agency?</strong> on the <a href="https://pantheon.io/register" target="_blank">signup form <span class="glyphicons glyphicons-new-window-alt"></span></a> to get more free features and really make the most of this guide. Size doesn't matter; you can sign up if you're an agency of one or one-thousand.
</p></div>

You should now have a Pantheon User Account. When you're ready, you may continue to the next lesson.
