There are occasions while you are working on your Drupal site thatÂ you would like to keep your progress hidden from the world as you prepare to go live or make updates.

This can be done by putting a username and password on the environment similar to basic authentication on Apache. If a request for a resource on your environment is received and the site is _private_ the requesting client will have to supply the authentication credentials you set in order to access the site.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<h4 class="info">Note</h4>
<p>When a Dev environment is locked, a lock icon will be added to the screenshot of a site on the Your Sites page.</p>
</div>

## Password Protect Your Site's Environments


You have the ability to password protect any of the available environments.

- Select the environment (e.g. Dev).
- Select **Security**.
- Select **Locked**.
- Choose a username and password.
- Click **Lock Environment**.

If other members of your team on the site need to access the site, they will also be able to view the authentication credentials when they log in to their accounts.

Now when your page refreshes you will notice that the environment is now "Private". You will also be able to see the credentials needed to access that environment.

You can set a different username and password for each environment. This is important if you only want the Live site publicly viewable, while Dev and Test can be private as you work on your code and content.

To verify that everything is working correctly, visit the URL of the environment that you have made private. You should see an authentication form where you can enter the username and password for that environment to start your session.

## Unlock a Site's Environment
When you are ready to make your environment public again, click **Security** on your Site Dashboard. Next to Environmental Access, click **Public**.
This will clear the credentials you entered and make the web accessible resources available without a basic authentication prompt.
