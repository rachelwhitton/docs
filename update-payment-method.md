<p>The Site Owner (shown under Team in the Dashboard) is the only person who can update an existing credit card or add a new one. If you want to assume site and billing ownership, the Site Owner needs to transfer ownership to you by going to <strong>Settings > Plan > Transfer ownership and billing of this site</strong>.</p></div>
