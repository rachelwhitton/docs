Drupal has a very good, built-in system for updating contributed modules through the administrative interface.

## Update Modules Through Drupal

1. Log in to Pantheon, and choose the site you want to update.
2. Select the **Code** tool in the Dev environment.
3. Set the Connection Mode to Â **SFTP**.
4. Click **Visit Development Site**, go to the Modules administration page (`/admin/modules/update`), and verify the Update Manager module is enabled.
5. Select the **Update** tab, and click **Check Manually**.
6. If there are updates available, select the ones you want and click **Download These Updates**.  
7. Once the updates are downloaded successfully, select **Perform updates in site maintenance mode** and click **Continue**.  
8. The updates will run, and if there are any database updates required, you will have the option to do so. If there were no issues, your module(s) will reflect their new versions in the Modules page.
9. Return to Dev environment of your Pantheon Site Dashboard and select the **Code** tab.
10. Enter a commit message and click **Commit** to add changes to version control.
