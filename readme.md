Documentation articles for the Pantheon website platform will initially be written in two types: Tools, which provide general information and step-by-step procedures for using different tools, and [Guides](/docs/guides), which explain how to solve website problems by breaking goals into phases and subphases, and providing rules-of-thumb as if-then statements.

## Tool Articles

Using a tool on or to develop your Pantheon Site that isn't documented here? Write us a tool article and make up to $200.  Tool articles must include the following information in their frontmatter:

## Guide Articles

Know how to solve problems that aren't the same every time? Write us a guide and make up to $500. Guides are, in Instructional Design parlance, "Systematic Approaches to Problem Solving" (SAP's). The solutions that SAP's guide us toward vary in their complexity, breadth, and depth. They can tell how agencies should approach developing  entire websites of varying types from start to finish with all details; they can explain how individual front-end developers should approach solving a specific non-recurrent type of problem; they can  They are made of phases, which match sub-goals with rules-of-thumb and procedures for accomplishing them. You can start with the template below:
```markdown

Explain the goal. What variables cause the problem to be solved differently in one case compared to the next case?  

## Phase 1 Goal

Explain the goal and identify variables

### If you (see, have, want to) (condition of the rule-of-thumb)
then you should:
  - Try doing this with that tool (include links and images where necessary)
  - Try doing this with that.

## Phase 2 Goal

Explain the goal and identify variables

### If you (see, have, want to) (condition of the rule-of-thumb)
then you should:
  - Try doing this with that tool (include links and images where necessary)
  - Try doing this with that.
